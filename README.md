# When was it built?

[*When was it built?*](http://blog.nkb.fr/when-was-it-built/) is a game for two people, where you need to guess the construction date of buildings.

It is based on the [Cities and Buildings Database](https://content.lib.washington.edu/buildingsweb/index.html) of the University of Washington.
